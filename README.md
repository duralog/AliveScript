# AliveScript

is a kind of mirror of [LiveScript](https://github.com/gkz/LiveScript). we use this version in production. it only intended to be a public place we can show off any improvements / changes / bugfixes. not intended for any real use. the LiveScript part will continue compiling LiveScript as usual)

some differences are
 - generator support
 - a some other things and maybe few bugfixes

## CHANGELOG

[TODO]

# LiveScript
is a language which compiles to JavaScript. It has a straightforward mapping to JavaScript and allows you to write expressive code devoid of repetitive boilerplate. While LiveScript adds many features to assist in functional style programming, it also has many improvements for object oriented and imperative programming.

Check out **[livescript.net](http://livescript.net)** for more information, examples, usage, and a language reference.
